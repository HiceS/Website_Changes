					<p>Tonight we machined the parts for our comb and finalized the designs for our robot (aside from the scraper).  With parts to actually fabricate, the robot has pushed forward and by this time next week the robot should finally be designed.  The programming team finally got started writing pseudo code.  We also started compiling the world championship video.  Stay tuned for Wednesday.

					<p>Today's meeting was very successful, our frame was fully assembled and on during our next meeting the electronics mounting panels and bumper panels will be added to the frame.  The proof of concept for our scraper design has moved forward and will probably serve its purpose during the next meeting.  Swoopes is fully prepared to attend its showing at Linear Technology and which happens this next Friday.  The design team has inched forward on its designs and is keeping ahead of the fabricators at this point in time.  </p>

					<p>Tonight we disclosed the basic design for our "Ping Pong Panic" robot to our entire team. Design continues in the background but prototypes of the scraper and the barrier are starting to take shape. We also hosted our copatriots in the Girl's Gen event and showcased our shop to them. Swoopes is back to 100% operation and is nice and clean.</p>
