SAFETY TIPS FROM 2471:
	<ul>
		<li>Safety Glasses are always a must at competition and in the shop but a common overlooked PPE item is ear plugs! Take hearing protection into consideration and always keep some ear plugs on hand.
			<br>
		<li>Keep your work space clear, not only is it a good way to stay organized, it also prevents minor as well as major injuries from happening. This tip also applies to the floor, prevent slips, trips and falls by sweeping and vacuuming after using machinery in the shop as well as the pit.
			<br>
		<li>Closed toed shoes, hair tied back, long pants and non baggy clothing. If this isn't already a rule on your team it would be a good idea to make it one. Accidents are bound to happen but by taking proper precaution you could save yourself from a major injury.
			<br>
		<li>Record the accidents that happen! Keeping an accurate record of accidents done in the shop and at competition will help your team correct mistakes and keep everyone safer.
			<br>
		<li>Get excited about safety! Safety is the most important thing in FIRST and in any manufacturing/engineering job. If companies go into great extents to put Safety first, then we should too. Also if you're not excited about safety in the shop, then you won't be excited about it when the judges come around at competition.
			<br>
		<li>Get your whole team involved! The Safety Captain's job isn't to constantly make sure everyone is wearing their safety glasses. Their job is to set the examples for your team to emulate.
